<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a third-year master's student at the Cognitive Neuroscience Communication Lab at Beijing Normal University, supervised by Professor Guoming Yu. My primary research focuses on human-computer interaction and cognitive neuroscience communication. Since 2019, I have also collaborated with Professor Kun Tang at Tsinghua University on projects related to adolescent health and well-being, as well as sexual and reproductive health and rights (SRHR). In the lab, I am mainly responsible for data analysis and have independently led multiple projects. In 2022, I earned my degree in Arts from the Communication University of China in TV Editing and Directing.

My academic background lies at the intersection of communication studies, public health, psychology, and cognitive neuroscience. I believe that as media‚Äîespecially AI‚Äîbecomes deeply interwoven with our lives, there is a pressing need for scholars with interdisciplinary expertise to seize opportunities for groundbreaking innovation. Therefore, I am dedicated to using cross-disciplinary approaches to address real-world health issues, regardless of traditional academic boundaries. I have published 3 papers, with 3 others currently under review.  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tr33OgQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao'><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Citations-9cf?style=flat&logo=Google%20Scholar">
